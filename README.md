## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Shobbylicious/Shobbylicious** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and the use of browser Developer Tools for debugging
- 👩‍💼 I’m open to opportunities as a QA Game Tester, Tech Support Specialist, Administrative Assistant, Bookkeeper, or Data Entry Clerk.
- 🎮 As a QA Game Tester, I developed an interest in using Unity and exploring game development. I have basic experience with Unity editing and using Plastic SCM for version control.
- 🌐 Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn, link information is in the bio.
